    synopsis: [
      "For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.” (Philippians 1:29) These words written by Apostle Paul would sound strange to many as they do not fit the image of God they have in their minds of a good and benevolent God who makes one’s best wishes come to pass. For some, such a God is fallible and unworthy of their worship.",
      "Even believing Christians struggle to understand why their heavenly Father grants suffering to His beloved children. They try to make sense of Paul’s disclosure in Philippians 1:29, but leave with unsettling thoughts. Why does our God, who indeed is love, grant suffering to His children? To what end does He grant it? Does it make us better Christians? Are we to take pleasure in it since they are from His wise and fatherly hands? How does it further the cause of Christ in the world?",
