# Lagos Bible Conference, 

The Lagos Bible Conference (LBC) is the annual flagship conference of Sovereign Grace Bible Church (and partners) dedicated to promoting the Bible as God's inerrant and infallible Word through a faithful exposition of it.

The need for such a gathering in Lagos was apparent, given the ignorance and lack of faithfulness in handling God's holy word.

This endeavor was set in motion by Pastor Joe Jacowitz (Christ Bible Church, CA, United States), Pastor Tony Okoroh (Sovereign Grace Bible Church, Lagos), Pastor Abiodun Longe (Upper Room Baptist Church, Lagos) and the pastor of the then Lagos Tabernacle, a church planted by the London Metropolitan Tabernacle.
